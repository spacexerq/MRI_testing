# Description
This script creates simple gradient sequence in .seq format. 
All the result sequences in .txt are stores in /grad_output/ directory

Launch the script in command line with 
> git clone https://github.com/spacexerq/MRI_testing
> 
> cd /MRI_testing/
> 
> python gui_GRAD_TEST.py

If any troubles with pypulseq or numpy datatype arise try to use 
> pip install git+https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq

instead of

> pip install pypulseq


## Optional
There is some already created sequences inside directories - could be used if needed. If not, you can delete .seq, .json and .txt files without any problems.
